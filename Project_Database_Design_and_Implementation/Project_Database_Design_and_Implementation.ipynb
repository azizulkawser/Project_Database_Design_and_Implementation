    "<h2> Scenario </h2>\n",
    "<p1> A New York based coffee shop chain is planning to expand its operations nationwide by opening multiple franchise locations. To facilitate this expansion and enhance operational efficiency, they are seeking to revamp their data infrastructure.</p1>\n",
    "<p2>Currently, the company's data is scattered across various systems including accounting software, suppliers' databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and spreadsheets. Now the task is to assess the data in these systems and create a centralized database that consolidates all the relevant information. Subsequently, design and implement the necessary database objects and populate them with the source data. As a final step, extract subsets of data as per the requirements of your business partners, export them, and then load them into staging databases that utilize different Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).</p2>\n",
    "<p3>By implementing these changes, we can enable the coffee shop chain to streamline their operations, improve decision-making processes, and establish a robust data infrastructure to support their national expansion plans.</p3><hr>"
